CatCare is a friendly little app that helps you look after your cats. Add your fur friends  with a cute photo, jot down the basics, and set gentle reminders so feeding, grooming, 
and vet visits never slip your mind. Simple, tidy, and made for real life. 🐾

Features
	•	Add cats with name, photo, breed, color, and age (years & months)
	•	Editable breed field with handy suggestions
	•	Beautiful cat list with photos and quick details
	•	Create reminders with cat + activity + date & time
	•	Optional repeat (e.g., every few hours/minutes)
	•	Works offline; your data stays on your device
	•	Clean, modern design with easy navigation

This project is my final project for 159.336 (Mobile Application Development). 
I designed and built the CatCare application from scratch, managing the full process from planning and UI design to implementation, testing, and polish.
